raw_data page
- this is where you should see the raw database as it is 
- figures and data visualization focus on the database change history, not the analysis info derived from these data.
- IMPORTANT: add crud functionality, maybe a toggleable button in the filters tab that shows an edit(pencil) icon at the side of each table entry when hovered. this toggles editable text for that entry. changes can be saved/canceled by clicking the check/cross icon that replaces the edit icon.
- you should be able to see how many entries were added/modified after uploading an excel file, could do this one using a figure, thinking of a pie chart with legend: new, updated, unchanged
- update the filters so you can filter: new, updated, changed... but also alerts
- could also add a drop down menu to choose which to highlight (table entries will change bg color): none, new, updated, changed, ...

dashboard page
- this is where the main figures and data visualization should be in, should be easily understood by higher up executives

alerts page
- this is where you can see specific alerts, could be cards that tell you: type of alert, urgency of alert, where to find it in the database??

home page
- idk yet, as of now it holds debug options (will be disabled upon release)
- can be settings page?
